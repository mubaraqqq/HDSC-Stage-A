# HDSC-Stage-A
This is a small project in exploratory data analysis using pandas, numpy, and seaborn. 
It is the first stage in a series of 8 stages of a remote internship organized by Hamoye AI labs designed to groom us to be data scientists.
The data is based on electricity utilities containing location of power plants, fuel units, fuel burned, the report year, etc.
